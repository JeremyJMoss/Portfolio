            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Jeremy and i am 28 years old. I am a self taught Software Developer. I am a Diagnostic Technician by trade looking to change up my career. My hobbies include coffee roasting, bread making and spending time with my wife and my 3 wonderful children.</p>
            
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I had no previous background in coding when i started and am still a service technician at Sutherland Nissan. I started my apprenticeship in 2013 because i didn't know what i wanted to do after school. I got relatively good at diagnostics and troubleshooting and electrical systems and am currently lead diagnostics technician and foreman at Sutherland Nissan on my way to becoming a Master Technician in February of next year if covid lockdowns ever end. I have found that code is constantly evolving and there is always more to learn which has made me want to pursue a career in coding, as the mechanical trade has limited paths to learn. I have been teaching myself to code through udemy courses and youtube videos. I also plan to pursue a computer science degree to help with the transition to a new career.</p>
            <h2>Coding Languages</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS</li>
              <li>Javascript</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have a particular love for vanilla CSS. I love that when you know it well it is very easy to make responsive websites with everything on the page exactly where you want it.</p>
