            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Jeremy and i am 28 years old. I am a self taught Software Developer. I am a diagnostic light vehicle technician by trade looking to change up my career. My hobbies include coffee roasting, bread making and spending time with my wife and my 3 wonderful children.</p>
            
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I had no previous background in coding when i started and am still a service technician at Clinton's Toyota. I started my apprenticeship in 2013 because i didn't know what i wanted to do after school. I got relatively good at diagnostics and troubleshooting and electrical systems. I have always enjoyed the fundamentals of a car and that translated well to my love for computers and how they work behind the scenes</p> 
            <p>I have found that code is constantly evolving and there is always more to learn which has made me want to pursue a career in coding, as the mechanical trade has limited pathway for further learning. I have done a beginner's coding bootcamp with The Hacking School Australia and I have been teaching myself to code through udemy courses and youtube videos. I am also currently undergoing a Certificate IV in Programming with Petersham Tafe.</p>
            <h2>Coding Languages</h2>

            </ul>
          </br>
            <p>I have a particular love for python. I love the syntax of the language and how easy it is to get something up and running without the need for a clunky syntax getting in the way. I have also found Javascript to be quite different but also nice to code in. As Javascript can be easy to visualise your code with the use of the browser.</p>
